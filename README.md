SauceDemo Selenium Automation Project=
This project demonstrates end-to-end Selenium automation for an e-commerce web application, SauceDemo. It simulates common user actions such as logging in, sorting products, adding items to the cart, viewing the cart, and completing the checkout process. This script is designed to showcase your skills in Selenium WebDriver, Java, and automation best practices.

.Login with valid credentials
.Sort products from low to high price
.Add products (t-shirt and backpack) to the cart
.Open and view the cart
.Complete the checkout process with user details
.Screenshot capture for failure scenarios
.Retries on stale elements to ensure stability

üîß Technologies Used
Selenium WebDriver: For automating the web interactions with the SauceDemo site.
.Java: The main programming language used to write the automation script.
.ChromeDriver: To interact with Google Chrome browser (can also be used in headless mode).
.Apache Commons IO: For capturing and saving screenshots during test failures.
.JUnit/TestNG (optional for future refactor): Testing framework that can be integrated for enhanced reporting and test management.
